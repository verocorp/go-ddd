# TODOS

Deferred work with context. Each entry carries enough for a cold pickup.

## T8 rename follow-ups (machine-local — meaningless outside Chris's machine)

- [ ] **Local directory rename** — `~/workspace/vero/go-ddd` → `~/workspace/vero/tesser-build`.
  - **Why:** the repo/module/tool renamed in T8 (PR #8); the local path is the
    last stale surface. Path-keyed Claude state (memory dir, session index,
    gstack slug) must move with it.
  - **How:** at a session boundary, run the `claude-project-migration` skill —
    it exists for exactly this. Do NOT rename mid-session.
  - **Then:** re-pin gbrain for the new path (`.gbrain-source` / re-register),
    and fix quanta's `.vscode/tasks.json` relative `../go-ddd` path (valid
    until the rename; re-sweep after).
  - **Risk of waiting:** path-keyed state keeps accumulating; the move gets
    costlier.

## Toolkit

- [ ] **Go-side `primitiveaccessor` analyzer** (norm strengthened 2026-07-19)
  - **What:** the accessor half of the no-primitive-exposure norm is enforced
    in Python only (TB010 flags a VO `@property`/method whose body is a bare
    `return self._x` with a primitive type). Go has the norm in the design doc
    (`docs/design-python-domain-detection.md` "Grounded against Go", amended:
    the `Money.Currency()` single-rep carve-out is closed) but no analyzer —
    `rationale/coverage.md` row "#6a/6b no primitive accessors" is still demo
    pending. Concretely: `examples/catalog/money.go`'s `Currency() string`
    accessor is the exact shape the amendment closes and is now a
    non-conformant example with nothing to flag it until this ships.
  - **How:** a `go/analysis` pass over VO-candidate types flagging exported
    methods that return a builtin/`*big.Rat`/`decimal` field unchanged
    (mirror `_bare_self_field_returned`); add the coverage row + demo in the
    same change.
  - **Why not now:** the 2026-07-19 change set was the Python consumer
    feedback wave; the Go mirror deserves its own predeclared demo per the
    coverage-matrix discipline.

- [ ] **Generic consumer activation recipe** (eng review 2026-07-19, TODO 12A)
  - **What:** an activation section for `skills/tesser-build` documenting how a
    consumer wires the skill into its agent host — Claude Code (Skill system
    auto-loading) vs Codex CLI (an `AGENTS.md` routing line pointing at
    `SKILL.md`) — each with a one-step verification.
  - **Why:** recurring documented gap (`skill-artifact-plans-need-activation-design`
    learning): skill-artifact plans design distribution (copy-in) but omit
    activation, so doctrine ships without reaching the consuming agents.
  - **Depends on:** the first verified pilot-consumer-side activation (Wave 3R eng
    review 1A consumption contract) — evidence first, then the recipe; never
    document a host path that hasn't been exercised once.
  - **Start at:** the de-identified relayed form of the pilot consumer's working
    `AGENTS.md` line.

- [ ] **Time-type taxonomy** (opened 2026-07-20 with the serialization norm)
  - **What:** one canonical wire form is pinned (aware-UTC ISO-8601,
    microsecond precision — `serialization.md` rule 3), but real domains need
    *several* time types — instant vs calendar date vs local time, and
    per-precision variants — each deserving its own leaf-VO shape and its own
    canonical form. Decide the taxonomy and per-type canonical policies so
    consumers aren't pigeon-holed into one type.
  - **Trigger:** the first datetime-bearing VO a consumer relays (or PR-B if
    the verified impl grows one).
  - **Why not now:** the pinned single form unblocks the serialization wave;
    the taxonomy is a modeling decision that deserves its own evidence.

- [ ] **Leaf-vs-compound discriminator: collect the hard cases** (2026-07-20)
  - **What:** the discriminator ("does the concept have a *standardized*
    canonical primitive representation? → leaf") decides borderline types —
    URL, E.164 phone, postal address, email-with-display-name. A wrong call is
    expensive to reverse (re-classification breaks construction AND
    serialization), so hard cases should be collected and ruled once, in the
    doc, as they surface.
  - **How:** append each borderline type + its ruling to
    `value-objects.md#decisions-you-must-make`; when 3+ accumulate, sharpen
    the discriminator's wording from the pattern.
  - **Why not now:** no hard case has actually surfaced yet; ruling on
    hypotheticals invents doctrine.

- [ ] **Change-handling red team (ops/migrations, pulled closer)** (2026-07-20)
  - **What:** red-team what can *change* under the settled norms and how each
    change is handled: a canonical form (persisted bytes → migration), a
    parts field (total record vs old rows — the migration caveat in
    `serialization.md`), a leaf↔compound re-classification, spec evolution,
    wire-shape versioning. Operational concerns were deliberately deferred
    ("static code only" — SKILL.md), but serialization puts persisted bytes
    downstream of these norms, so part of the ops/migration story lands
    sooner than the rest.
  - **How:** enumerate change classes → for each, name the blast radius, the
    loud/silent profile, and the sanctioned procedure; fold results into
    `serialization.md` (per-edge migration decisions) and a future
    change-sequencing doc.
  - **Why not now:** wave (a/b/c) ships the static norms first; the red team
    needs those fixed as its subject.

- [ ] **Behavior-rebuild ergonomics (performance-triggered only)** (2026-07-20)
  - **What:** behavior methods rebuild new instances THROUGH the public
    constructor via canonical forms (`MoneyAmount(canonical_decimal(total))`) — ruled
    2026-07-20; the cost is parse overhead only, and cosmetic "ickiness" is
    not evidence. If a consumer measures a real hot-path cost, the recorded
    candidate designs are: a TB003-sanctioned same-class private rebuild
    (`object.__new__(EnclosingClass)` + setattr of declared fields inside the
    class's own methods — Go's package-private struct-literal idiom ported),
    or union-typed doors (rejected once already: special cases for a
    perf-only benefit).
  - **Trigger:** a measured performance problem in a real consumer, not
    aesthetics.

- [ ] **Representation types missing from the primitive set** (opened
  2026-07-20, found while building TB016)
  - **What:** `typed_checks._PRIMITIVE_TYPES` is `{str, int, float, bool,
    bytes, complex, Decimal}` — it omits `date`, `datetime`, `time`, `UUID`.
    Every check keyed on it under-reaches on those types: TB010 does not flag
    an accessor handing back a raw `date`, and TB016 does not flag a compound
    holding one. `datetime` is already named in the serialization norm (it has
    a pinned canonical text policy), so its absence here is an inconsistency,
    not an open question.
  - **Measured blast radius (2026-07-20):** adding `date`/`datetime`/`time`
    leaves `examples/python`, `examples/python-app` and `examples/serdepy`
    clean and the full tessercheck-py suite green. The entire effect is on
    `examples/errorspy` — 2 new TB016 + 2 new TB010 findings on `DateWindow`
    (see the entry below).
  - **Why not now:** it widens **TB010**, a shipped consumer-facing check with
    an adoption ratchet — a consumer's `date`-typed accessors would begin
    failing. That is a norm-strengthening ruling of the same kind as the
    2026-07-19 accessor-primitive ban, and it belongs to the maintainer, not
    to a checker-implementation PR. One shared set, one ruling, both checks —
    divergent per-check primitive sets would be the real smell.

- [ ] **examples/errorspy is not conformant to the serialization norm**
  (opened 2026-07-20, surfaced by TB015)
  - **What:** `errorspy/domain/values.py`'s `DateWindow` violates several of
    the 2026-07-20 rulings at once: a `__str__` on a two-field compound (the
    zero-dunder contract — TB015 flags this today), a `from_spec` classmethod
    (closed by the (b)-uniform one-door ruling; TB013 does not reach it
    because that check is scoped to identity objects), and `start`/`end`
    accessors handing back raw `date` values (invisible only because of the
    primitive-set gap above).
  - **Why CI is still green:** `errorspy` is deliberately gated with
    `--select TB020` only (the comments norm) — it is the error-norms worked
    example and was never swept for serialization. Honest gap, stated.
  - **The real decision:** sweeping it changes what the example *teaches*
    (`DateWindow` is a vehicle for error propagation, and wrapping its bounds
    in leaf VOs adds surface unrelated to that lesson). Either sweep it and
    accept the added surface, or declare it out of the serialization norm's
    scope in the tree's own README. Not a silent choice either way.

- [ ] **python-app pre-existing error-path test gaps** (opened 2026-07-20,
  PR-B ship review; explicitly NOT that PR's debt)
  - **What:** two error surfaces in `examples/python-app` have never had
    tests, predating the parts restructure. (1) The HTTP handler's `_respond`
    translation matrix — all four branches (`BadRequest`→400,
    `DomainError`→`status_for(kind)`, `InfraError`→503, bare
    `Exception`→500) are the boundary that turns domain failure into wire
    status, and only the first two are now exercised (by the deactivate
    lifecycle tests). (2) `InMemoryCampaignRepository`'s `down=True`
    InfraError branch on all four methods — the flag exists solely to make
    that path testable and nothing calls it.
  - **Why it matters here:** the anatomy is what consumers adopt, and the
    error-translation boundary is one of the parts they copy most directly;
    an untested matrix teaches a matrix nobody checked.
  - **How:** a `tests/test_error_translation.py` driving each branch through
    `Handler` with a stub client that raises each error type, plus a
    `down=True` repo asserting 503 through the handler rather than the raw
    exception.
  - **Why not now:** the deactivate fix was scoped to the unreachable-state
    defect and the negative paths on code that PR introduced; sweeping
    pre-existing surfaces would have hidden that change inside a larger diff.

- [ ] **Repository read paths / projections — a named norm gap** (opened
  2026-07-20, PR-B outside review)
  - **What:** the serialization norm covers how domain data crosses an edge
    but says nothing about READ paths. The verified impl's
    `CampaignRepository.all()` reconstructs every aggregate (row → spec →
    constructor, invariants re-run) just to feed a flat read view
    (`list_links`) — correct and honest at template scale, but a bad clone
    at consumer scale: a list endpoint over 100k aggregates becomes full
    hydration, and one stale invalid row breaks an unrelated projection.
    The undecided question: does the anatomy teach a read-side
    query/projection port (a port returning parts-shaped projections
    straight from storage, no aggregate hydration) alongside the aggregate
    repository, and what keeps it honest (no invariant re-run on reads —
    is that acceptable, and where is it stated)?
  - **Trigger:** the first consumer with a list/report endpoint over a
    non-trivial aggregate count, or the reports-context restructure.
  - **Why not now:** it is a norm-level ruling (repositories.md +
    serialization.md scope), not a PR-B patch; inventing it inline would
    violate the evidence-first discipline.

- [ ] **Checker contracts as fixtures-first** (2026-07-20)
  - **What:** a check's *normative* contract artifact is its
    `good/bad` fixture pair set — authored and reviewed BEFORE the checker,
    with the doc prose describing and pointing at the fixtures, never the
    other way around. Prevents prose-derived checkers from encoding an
    imprecise sentence as analyzer semantics.
  - **How:** apply starting with the serialization-wave checks (PR-C): land
    fixture pairs as the reviewed contract, then the checker that satisfies
    them; the meta-test already enforces pair existence.
  - **Why not now:** it IS now — this entry records the discipline so it
    outlives the wave.
